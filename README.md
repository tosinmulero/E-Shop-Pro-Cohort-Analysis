ðŸ“Š Cohort Analysis â€“ tracking customer behavior over time based on acquisition/first purchase.

ðŸ§® RFM Analysis â€“ segmenting customers by recency, frequency, and monetary value.

ðŸ¤– K-Means Clustering â€“ grouping customers into actionable retention segments.

ðŸ’¡ Business Insights & Recommendations â€“ tailored strategies to improve retention and engagement.
